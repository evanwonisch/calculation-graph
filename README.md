# calculation_graph
 
This is an automatic differentiator. It is presented to better understand how libraries like tensorflow have the ability to calculate gradients in complex calculation networks like Neural Networks

It is object-oriented and in Java. One defines first a Graph, wich defines how the forward calculations should happen. Later one can transform this graph automatically to its partial derivatives with respect to choosen variables.
